# Assignment 5
## Fork and IPC

### Tasks:

1. Write a program that forks 2 child processes.  Child 1 prints a message every 1 sec.  Child 2 sleeps for 10 secs, then kills child 1, then sleeps for 10 secs and terminates.  The parent waits for both child processes to terminate then exits.  Each process should print a 1-line message including its pid before/after each significant action such as sleep, kill, terminate, etc.

2. Write programs of liveproducer.c and livecomsumer.c as demonstrated in IPC-2 class using POSIX Shared Memory API. Your program should work for any number of producers but with one consumer.
