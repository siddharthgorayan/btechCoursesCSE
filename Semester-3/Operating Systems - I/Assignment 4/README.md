# Assignment 4
## Processes

Watch video lectures of Prof John Kubi on fork system call (links are given in LM4) and go through my slide deck to run the following programs on process creation in Unix/Linux environment and clearly explain your outputs in a PDF report. 

procEx1.c, procEx2.c, procEx3.c, procEx4.c, procEx5.c in lec06-07-Processes.pdf (play with various procedure calls, commented out in the programs and run multiple times to observe variation in the outputs)

fork.c in Prof John Kubi on fork system call (links are given in LM4)

 

Read man pages related to fork etc. If you have any further queries, pl. post on the discussion thread for this tutorial.
