# Conclusion

* The language design for DevaN started with a thought and passion to produce something out of the box which is not present till date and hence we decided to design a programming language in Hindi.

* It came as a surprise to us when we came to know that such a language existed already, but to our relief, when we searched about the language, it wasn’t developed as a full fledged language at all. (Described in Introduction and Criticism).

* We tried to implement the language keeping in mind all the difficulties we faced while learning the language and hence implemented all the features which were necessary and eliminated all the `boring` features.

* After forming certain rules for DevaN, we later realised that these can’t be implemented and carried on further because of some clashes with other features and some limitations, and hence we learnt to make a plan and think about all the scenarios before introducing any new feature to our language.

* We learnt to take users’ reviews about the new features we add into the language because it’s the user who will ask us `What if this happens?` , and then we would need to think about a solution to his question.

* While we used to program in C language, we often used to ask, `Why is this rule even there?` , without thinking about the reason, and now when we had to design DevaN, we had the answers to all our questions.

* We got to know about various paradigms of the programming languages and the differences between them.

* While writing the Appendix for our language, we learnt about various aspects a programming language covers, when we defined those terms for our own Language.

* Since it was just a language `Design` , we had a liberty to extend our imagination and find ways of tackling the problems and making the user interface *The Best* , without worrying about how the language is being interpreted and compiled.

* **Interestingly**, some of us who had our native language as Telugu, also got to learn Hindi, which is the best part of this project XD

## Concluding Points:

From planning, execution, testing, updating (and repeat), we learnt **a lot!**.
It was the idea of our project which made us work continuously and put all our efforts in DevaN to make it live. 

Had it been a language in English, we can’t imagine that working with this project would have been so much fun, because the imagination in that case collapses to some minor changes in the already existing languages.

as DevaN says in its own words:
**Test me for plag, and you won’t find even 0.000000000000000000001% of me matching with any other language! I am one of My Kind.**
