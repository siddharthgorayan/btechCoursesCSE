#  Evolution of DevaN
 
## Overview:
 
 
As per the number of updates till now, the evolution of DevaN can be understood to have taken place in the following three stages:
 
 
## Stage 1:
 
 
* We started with an initial idea of developing a language which is not only different from any other language and offers vast features to make programming easy to understand and implement but also offers more convenience and readability to the user.
* Since the main goal of our language was to design a language which can eliminate the language barrier of the people whose native language is Hindi and they can't implement anything in English. This covers a huge population of people in India. So DevaN was developed to be written in Hindi and will be continued in the later stages also.
* We adopted an Imperative Paradigm which follows both procedural and object oriented programming. But in the first stage, the language only focussed on the procedural aspect of the programming. It introduced Functions, loops, arrays etc and gave a very brief introduction to the language without digging deep into it.
* In this stage it focussed on eliminating the complexity from the programming languages by introducing certain features which enhances the feasibility. It defined the scope of variables in different functions and also introduced the feature which eliminates the use of pointers and reduces the complexity to another level.
* We noticed that using a lot of parentheses in the code makes it look ugly and space consuming which makes the overall program bulky, so we decided to use indentations after every specific function, loops etc and ditched the parentheses reducing the visual bulk of the program and made our program look prettier.
* We started up with the `नमस्कार` program, introducing to the language and maintaining the goal of implementing everything in Hindi.
* We then explained how easy it can be to swap 2 values by calling a function `without using pointers`.
* Having noticed the problem of reallocation of memory everytime it runs out of memory, we decided to keep the array dynamically allocated by default. So you don’t need to worry about how much space is left in the array.
* Declaring the data type of a variable was also a task which needed to be taken care of every time you declare a variable. We eliminated the problem by letting the user just declare the variable and assign a value to it. The data type gets automatically defined after the assignment of the type of value to it.
* Surprising but true, we had only 7 reserved keywords when we initially started developing DevaN, and now it has increased to a level up.


## Stage 2:
 
 
* We carried on our idea of enhancing the convenience of the users by offering them a wide variety of features to make programming easier.
* We extended this idea and offered various methods in the Arrays which makes the most commonly used processes easier to implement.
* The main focus in the Arrays was to reduce the use of loops for implementing various tasks on array like printing, scanning, inserting, deleting etc.
* We introduced methods like `डालो`, `निकलो`, `मिटाओ` etc to add and delete elements from the array. Along with that we introduced ways to print and scan for the elements of the arrays without using loops and also told a way to insert `n` number of elements in the array without using `any` loop.
* Observing that the words in Hindi can be written using different letters in the `Hindi Varnamala` and they are all correct in pronunciation, we made sure that any keyword, function names and variable names, once declared in one particular spelling, can’t be changed while calling it again.
Example: `प्रारम्भ` and `प्रारंभ` aren't the same.
* In the Stage 1, we initially started using the well known convention of increment and decrement operators but having observed that people need to be explained about almost everything about a new language which makes the learning process slow, we tried to make things as obvious as they appear and hence we decided not to use the well known increment and decrement operators.
The increment and decrement operators in DevaN happen in an obvious manner.
Example: `क = क + 1` and not `क ++`
* By the end of Stage 2, in the process of enhancing the convenience of the user, we introduced a lot of new keywords whose usage is quite obvious by the name and at the same time very convenient. The list of keywords is still growing.
 
 
## Stage 3:
 
 
* Having reached this stage where we have defined a lot of new keywords and conventions, there was a need to keep a track of all the things in a document so that new features can’t override the already implemented features and the users of the language can refer to the document for the syntactical and conventional details of the language, which resulted in the introduction to the Appendix A.
* Added more methods to implement various commonly used operations like finding the maximum and minimum element in the array, sorting, reversing and searching in the array etc.
* By the end of the Stage 3, we had over 17 keywords whose uses are quite obvious when we see the name but the existence of such methods in DevaN makes it much more convenient as compared to other programming languages.
 
 
## Ending Remarks: 
 
 
* Although DevaN has evolved a lot within a span of a few weeks, it’s still evolving and we are still working to make it better and the best.
* We are yet to touch the OOPs part of DevaN which is a wide area to dig in and therefore we haven’t touched it till now to devote the sufficient amount of time it deserves.
* There can be some already added features which may not be feasible for us to carry on forward in the later stages.
* There can be some more hidden domains we need to work on in DevaN to enhance user convenience and feasibility, while maintaining the main goal of our language.
 
and as DevaN has to say in its own words: 
**" Another Dope Version Of Me Is Still Evolving! "**
