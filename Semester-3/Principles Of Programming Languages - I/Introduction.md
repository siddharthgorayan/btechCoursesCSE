 * The idea is to design and implement a language which is different from the existing languages and help a large section of people to start programming.

 * We have thought of designing a language which has everything written in Hindi Script, from syntax to variable and strings, everything in Hindi!


## Goal of our Language:


 * The goal is to target the people who neither understand English, nor can they write it down but have an interest in programming.

 * The goal also targets a large section of students in Engineering Colleges who have never been introduced to English in their School times.

 * There exists a large number of students from various state/central boards where the subjects like Physics, Chemistry and even Mathematics are taught in Hindi Language.

 * Even the most important Entrance Exam for Engineering students - JEE gives an option to attempt the Exam either in Hindi or in English, which may be further extended to other languages too. Keeping in mind that a considerable number of students coming to the best colleges in India have Hindi as their main language, it is quite fair to design and implement a language where the students can code in Hindi.

 * The language also aims at avoiding any complex rules and regulations which makes the language difficult to understand and code.

 * The aim is to provide a seamless coding experience to the user by making it as simple as possible.

 * Summing up all the points above, our language aims at providing such a programming experience to the user that even a person with no background of science can easily code in Hindi Language.
