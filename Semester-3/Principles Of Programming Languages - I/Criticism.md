# Criticism About DevaN

1. The first question/ criticism regarding DevaN is that when such a language already exists which is implemented in Hindi, then why is there even a need for another language. This claim isn’t true as, although Kalaam is that one language which is implemented in Hindi, but Kalaam has many limitations and the idea behind Kalaam has not been taken forward. So there is still a need for such a language which is implemented in Hindi and more importantly it should offer a good amount of features to make the language convenient to the users.
Following are the limitations of Kalaam which favours the need of development of a language in Hindi: 
* It offers just 8 functions as of now with functionality limited to printing, scanning, if, else and while loop.
* It doesn’t have any defined programming paradigm which it aims to achieve when the language is developed completely.
* The language appears to be just a translation from English to Hindi of C language.
* Even the translation is not done properly and variables like “a”, “b” … alphabets are still used in the language.
* Some predefined function names are just translated to Hindi Script and it still has the English Words, like: पुश()
* To sum up, the Kalaam language appears to be just an INCOMPLETE translation from C English Script to C Hindi Script.
* It didn’t aim to improve the user experience and make it seamless and easy so that anyone with just basic knowledge can use it.

2. Although we have left no stones unturned to enhance the user experience, it may turn out at later stages due to some inbuilt functionalities that the processing of this language slows down, which anyhow is beyond the scope of language designing.

3. The paradigm of the language being Imperative, one might ask for the Object Oriented Paradigm of DevaN which is not yet introduced.

4. Although the syntactic and conventional rules for DevaN have been laid out keeping in mind the convenience of the users, some people may not find it worthwhile of the appearance. For instance, decreasing the use of parentheses and replacing it with colon may be appealing to some people but might not be appealing to the others.

5. Some of the rules like the elimination of `double quotes` for representing a string and use of `square parentheses` for representing a variable inside the string overlapped with other text and ways have to be found to resolve such errors in the updates.

**Criticism is often a part from the users’ side who can interact, use and implement the language and come out with various suggestions, improvement ideas which we sometimes refer to as critics.**

**So we are welcome to all the suggestions and improvement ideas from your side.**

**We would try our best to make them live in DevaN.**
